"Update and some advice:These whitening strips really work, they make my teeth look noticeably whiter after just a few uses. However, Iâve had to adjust how I use them because they cause sensitivity and some pain several hours later. For example, if I leave them on for more than 20 minutes, I start feeling sharp sensitivity, especially when I drink water or coffee afterward. Now, I limit my usage time to max 20 mins, and it helps a bit with the discomfort. The results are great, but the sensitivity is a downside. If you have sensitive teeth like me, you might want to be cautious.","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024",4.0,105,December,2,1

"The speaker sounds a bit better than the past generation, and the sounds are noticeably clearer (or less muddy). Although I like both the old and new designs, I personally like this a bit more. It feels surprisingly high quality in the hand and is the obviously better deal when compared with a HomePod mini's price-to-performance ratio. I am a big fan of this Echo Dot generation's aesthetics. To me, it looks and feels premium--like a tech product I would leave purposely visible as part of my area, opposed to one I would manage hidden under my desk, behind a lamp, etc. My favorite new feature is the inclusion of a tap-to-play/pause function, and my biggest complaint is the lack of further music/media integration on the Alexa mobile app (as trying to play or queue up specific songs/playlists from Apple Music can be frustrating).Overall, you can't go wrong with this speaker for the price (and functionality it offers), especially when pairing two for a stereo pair.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2024",5.0,166,December,4,2

I have a tower power strip that is pretty full. Sits on floor. The other black cords in there don't really show. Kind of blend in with the shadows near the floor. This one looks terrible and the white sticks out like a sore thumb and a beacon in the night. Looks really messy and tacky. I honestly would not have purchased this device if I had known it had a black cord. Never seen a white cord from Amazon. I should have looked at the pics more thoroughly perhaps.

"Just not that great. I traded my old Echo Dots (small pucks) for this and 2 Echo Pops.So here we go....It comes with it's own LARGE WHITE plug almost 3 inches big. No more USB which makes it difficult to place- I have USB outlets to save space.The Dot itself is big and awkward. It doesn't fit into places easily. Older Dots could be mounted on the wall, under cabinets, and on the sides of a nightstand and still operate. These larger Dots just take up space and don't hide well, especially with the bright white cord and fat plug.It lights up the same as all Alexa stuff. Nothing new or fantastic.It seems to mis-hear a lot. More than older Dots.I can't go over Sound Quality because I only use this Echo Dot for light control and rarely Spotify. Since I moved houses it's just a voice controlled light switch. I used my older Echo Dots for motion sensors, lights, alarms door locks, sequences before moving.If you are looking to ""upgrade"" I'd just hold onto older Dots.It's not a status symbol to show off an Echo Dot. I don't want it sitting out on my counters, shelves, nightstands etc.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024",2.0,199,December,4,2
"I bought the Echo Dot hoping it would make a decent white noise machine and I was deeply mistaken. I on random occasions can get the Dot to play 'rain sounds' properly but most of the time I was met with a long monologue informing me I could pay a fee for white noise if I wished. Any effort to decline the subscription or try to get the Dot to just play the free version of white noise was met with silence.I tried to research how to fix the issue and most people online said to request 'Sleep Sounds'. My Dot recognized this command and would even say 'playing sleep sounds now' but nothing would play. Also, in the instances where I was able to get rain sounds to play it doesn't loop, it will abruptly stop without you asking and you'll have to pull teeth in order to get the white noise back.I don't have other Amazon home products so I wanted this for the white noise and the alarm clock. So, right now it's just a glorified alarm clock.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024",1.0,181,December,4,2

"My super old echo 1st gen (circa 2014) was better than this.1.  This is awkward to hold...possibly this is on purpose forcing you to purchase the stand for it.2.  It is a touch screen and boasts the ability to watch videos, video chat, etc.  There is no built in battery and the power cord is only 3 ft long, which limits these abilities.3.  Doesn't recognize commands out of the box.  You have to activate skills to do basic commands.  This can get a bit confusing because you are supposed to be able to do all of your controls from the touch screen directly from the Echo Show.  It is not very user friendly.  You are also supposed to be able to control all your devices from the Alexa app on your phone, which I also find not very user friendly.Overall I am very disappointed.  I am sure this device would work as I would want it to work but I do not have the time to get a phD in figuring out the settings.

"TL;DR summary: Defective model; find an old model, or wait for the next oneMaybe I got 2 lemons in a row, but I doubt it.I've bought 8 Echo Show devices (3 different models) since the first one in 2018...and that first one is still going strong 6.5yrs of constant use later (even though Alexa seems to have gotten only stupider instead of smarter over time)! (Won't even get into how many other Echo/Alexa products I've been pleased with.)I bought this ""newest model"" of the Show 5 (in the new Cloud Blue color) in Oct 2024. Within hours of setup, it was acting up, and doing so in some ways that none of my others ever have after years of use. I called Amazon, did all the troubleshooting, and an hour later, they finally agreed to send out a new one. The 2nd one (which arrived also looking brand new, not returned and repackaged) acted exactly the same as the first, with exactly the same weird random defects.ISSUES:**1** The most frequent & most recurring issue: The screen would go entirely black (as if unplugged), but if I said ""Alexa,"" the colored bar would appear at the bottom to let me know it was listening. If I just asked a simple question, it would give me a verbal response (as expected), and write the words it was saying in white text on the same pitch black background, then it would go black again. (If you haven't had an Echo Show, there's always a visual background on at all times, albeit sometimes dim if it's in ""sleep"" mode...at least the way they've always worked for me. IF a ""screen off mode"" option exists, I wasn't using it, so it was not behaving normally.) Worse, if I asked anything else of it while in this ""black screen state,"" such as ""Play music"" or ""turn on kitchen light"" or tried to activate one of its many ""Skills"" (AKA ""apps"") it would again show the colored bar that indicating it was listening as I spoke, then...NOTHING, nada, nil...no response at all. I could repeat the command, or try another...same thing. So, it wasn't frozen, just glitching. The only way to stop it was to pull it from power, then plug it back in. It would then work ok for a bit before doing the same thing again within hours.I wasted 2-3 hours troubleshooting mostly this issue with 4 different Amazon reps over 3 calls (before and after receiving the 2nd one). Amazon claims that this is NOT a known issue (I don't believe that for a second since this exact model had already been out for 1+ yrs prior to my purchase, yet the exact same thing happened to me twice in a row on two brand new devices). Just for **** & giggles (and bc I really wanted a new device to use in my kitchen plus they keep discontinuing the older models with proven reliability), I asked if they could send me a 2nd replacement (3rd device), but in a different color (thinking that maybe the Cloud Blue had a defective batch and I got 2 of the bad eggs), but nope. So I just returned both defectives for refund and am doing without.MORE TYPICAL ISSUES (that I very rarely experience on my other Echo Shows, but 2+ times on this model over just the first 24hrs):*2* Completely freezing on a screen completely unresponsive (have to pull plug to fix);*3* Not going into ""sleep mode"" (dim screen, just a fixed bckgd image w/ clock) as expected after hours in a dark room;*4* OR the opposite...not waking from ""sleep mode"" when I return to the room, turn on the light, and start making noise (it's supposed to recognize someone's around, brighten the screen, and resume it's active standby state of scrolling news stories, recipes, product recommendations, etc.)...not even when I'd say ""Alexa""!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024",1.0,647,December,5,2

But if you ask her what time it is during her ad break, be prepared for the silent treatment. Priorities, I guess.The Bad:Ads, Ads, Ads: I didnât realize I was signing up for a 24/7 Amazon infomercial. Iâve turned off more settings than a NASA launch control panel, yet the ads keep comingâlike that one overly persistent sales rep who doesnât take a hint.Itâs distracting: Picture this: Iâm sitting at my desk, trying to get some work done. I glance over for the time, and BAM! A supplement ad pops up. Nothing says âbe productiveâ like being guilt-tripped into buying fish oil capsules.The Ugly:Even after diving deep into the settings to turn off every notification, ad preference, and suggested game (seriously, who wants to play a game on this thing?), it still found a way to sneak in more ads. TWICE every minute for SIX seconds. Yes, I timed it because I have nothing better to do when waiting for the clock to reappear. Thatâs 20% of my life stolen by a device I bought.Final Verdict:The Echo Show 5 is like that friend whoâs great at parties but wonât stop trying to sell you their MLM products. It has so much potentialâsmart home integration, weather updates, alarmsâbut itâs ruined by its obsession with turning your home into a virtual billboard. If youâre into Stockholm Syndrome, this might just be the gadget for you. Otherwise, save your money and buy a regular clock. At least those donât try to upsell you protein shakes.I have rated 5 stars but in reality it really deserves 2/5 stars. One for the time-telling (when it feels like it) and one for the screen (even if itâs mostly ads). Amazon, pleaseâjust let us enjoy a peaceful clock.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024",5.0,424,December,5,2
"I have had several Echo 5 for years. I bought a new upgraded generation. If I touch or move the Echo 5 the plug falls out of the device socket.

"So, you may no longer use this as a visual telephone device - my friends and I use this to talk on all the time - earlier versions of the Echo Show 8 were much better than even placing an I-Phone call with FaceTime.  Now the new version's DEFAULT view is of your whole room and background - not a close-up face to face call type of thing.  They do this so it can act as a security device - which is just stupid, because it is a live view and doesn't even record!  If I wanted a security camera, that's what I'd get.  But all previous versions were ""close up"" - I called to see if I could change the default view - but NOPE! This is their new default.  Won't be buying any more and I have about 10 of them in my house.  As I said, absolutely horrid!  The colors are distorted horribly as well.  When I called my friend, she said - Do you have a bad sunburn?  (Duh!  No, it's the middle of winter... but that's how it looked!) This is the third MAJOR complaint that I've had with Amazon in as many mouths, and I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall... they are a company who no longer works to produce products and services that their customers want, leading me to believe, that with the change of leadership, they are going into that well-known phase of so many companies known as DECLINE!","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024",1.0,250,December,5,2

"I have three of these devices in my house, one being an Echo Show 8. Apparently, spending a lot of money on these devices is not enough, because I am constantly bombarded with subtle and not-so-subtle pitches to buy, or subscribe to, products and services offered by Amazon. The uptick in recent months has been obvious. Even the innocuous games, requests or routines I like bring suggestions to upgrade or buy.Shopping suggestions are sometimes helpful but can also feel like a money-grab when it suggests I re-order things I've just ordered in a six-month quantity.And the AI is not great. For instance, I asked it to stop showing me sports scores because it was spoiling the results of games I had recorded. So instead I'm greeted with highlight thumbnails that do the same thing.You can turn off most of this stuff by activating Do Not Disturb, but that also quiets most notifications you've set up.In 2024, I would expect better technology.

It is a bit frustrating that they kept trying to blame my wifi when all evidence pointed at the device being lacking (including the way the issue was ultimately resolved), but at least this finally works now. If anyone else has a similar issue, make sure they have you try the tap/non-bluetooth method for older devices so you don't have as rough a time getting yours working.Still, I advise looking into their newer devices if you don't want the potential hassle.

I want to play Amazon music, but it refuses to recognize anything I try to play even though all the skills are enabled and it's set to default. The only music service I've been able to get working is Pandora, even after researching for hours. I thought the white noise was great, at first. Then the Internet disconnected in the middle of the night and Alexa yells a big long message about the Internet being down and what to do waking my kids up. It cannot be turned off. Are you kidding me? Either the white noise has to be turned waaaay down so that you can't hear the message or you have to turn it off at night. Either way you don't get white noise. Some of the things you can program it to do are cute, but honestly the more I read up on issues that I find the more I get the impression that this whole product is overly complicated and poorly designed.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024",2.0,221,November,6,2

"The Amazon Echo Dot Kids (newest model) is an absolute hit in our household! Itâs specifically designed for kids with safety in mind, featuring robust parental controls that give me peace of mind.

"I bought the Owl for my son last year for his 7th birthday. He had been begging for an echo dot. He was SO excited to finally get it. Itâs cute, durable, turns on, lights up, she talks, seems greatâ¦ but we canât get it to connect to our WiFi. Weâve tried consistently, I even downloaded the Alexa app like the instructions say to do and it just wonât do it. The ring light at the bottom of the owl, changes color when itâs ready to connect but it wonât actually connect. Pretty disappointing because now it just sits collecting dust. My son always asks me to set it up and weâve tried many times, and followed the directions as given and she just wonât connect. Waste of money in opinion with a sad little boy who wanted this thing so badly for it to just become a paperweight. Weâve even changed our WiFi provider a few months ago and tried it again and it still wonât work properly. We finally gave up on it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024",2.0,175,November,6,2

The first year of the subscription is free, with a small fee afterward (check the terms), but it's definitely worth it.

During that process, I was met with the representative telling me that there was nothing wrong with the unit itself, that there was Something wrong on my end, and that they could do nothing else to help me.

He uses the timer frequently and likes to have quiet music playing on a sleep timer. Would I say your kid needs this, nope. However, I do think it can help a child be more independent- especially if there are any challenges with reading/ delays/ because itâs much easier to âspeakâ to Alexa to ensure your alarm is set etc.So necessary?

The ability to control her nightlight and change its color to match her mood has made bedtime much more enjoyable.

My daughter enjoys asking for music, and I appreciate that it pulls from her Spotify Kids account, ensuring that the songs playing are always age-appropriate.Sheâs also discovered the joy of storytelling; she frequently asks Alexa to tell her a story.

I'm only giving this three stars. Delivery was great and the product is pretty good. I minus one star because it amazes me how in the world does a couple of packages in a very strong box end up broken. This is not the fault of delivery. The box itself is very strong. But I opened it up and one or two packages are always broken. How does that happen? Unless it's at the manufacturing end. They need to do a better job. Perhaps during packaging a machine is Miss adjusted and the plastic wrap gets ripped? But then the noodles would end up on the manufacturing floor not in the box? I see many comments here stating the same thing. Luckily it's an easy fix of just gathering the noodles up. Not a waste just an inconvenience. And at this price I would still buy them because they're a great nifty idea. As an adult male I need at least two packages to make a meal. So I get nine meals at this incredible price.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024",3.0,176,November,7,3

"I was shocked at the small amount of macaroni in the package. I usually add my veggies to Annieâs Mac and cheese and have a nice size bowl and 4 other servings. With Kraft Mack and cheese, I tripled the amount of veggies and still didnât have much left food. So you will not get enough to feed a family of four without other dishes. The taste is excellent. I personally would find it too strong without my added vegetables.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024",3.0,80,February,8,3

"This is excellent Mac & Cheese.  Just boil water, drain and mix in the readymade cheese sauce.  I love boxed Mac and Cheese, but donât like having to add the milk, butter and powder.  Although, with the Rapid Mac Cooker, itâs fast to make.  Kraft Deluxe doesnât do well in the Rapid Mac Cooker.  So I now boil the water on the stove.  The box says to boil the macaroni for 11 to 12 minutes.  I always taste-test pasta as it cooks.  It only takes about 8.5 to 9 minutes.  It comes out slightly al dente, but I like that way better than having the macaroni overcooked and mushy.  Of course, thatâs up to each individual.  If you like the pasta a lot more tender, then Iâd estimate 10 to 12 minutes.  Any way you like it, itâs excellent Mac & Cheese and very easy and fast to make.  The sauce mixes in much more easily than the powder does.  Just buy some and ENJOY!  The price is much better at the warehouse clubs.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024",5.0,174,January,8,3
