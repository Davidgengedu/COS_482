"My son loves Paw Patrol, so this was a fun find. I‚Äôve noticed most of the ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù shaped pastas don‚Äôt hold up as well when you stir the cheese packet in. There‚Äôs lots of holes and thin areas, so they tend to break up and look mashed.Tip: Use a spoon, not a fork, to stir. They‚Äôll hold their shape better! Also, try adding a little pat of butter to get rid of the ‚Äúfake cheesy chemical‚Äù taste. I find it tastes more like boxed Mac & cheese that way.
