"My super old echo 1st gen (circa 2014) was better than this.1.  This is awkward to hold...possibly this is on purpose forcing you to purchase the stand for it.2.  It is a touch screen and boasts the ability to watch videos, video chat, etc.  There is no built in battery and the power cord is only 3 ft long, which limits these abilities.3.  Doesn't recognize commands out of the box.  You have to activate skills to do basic commands.  This can get a bit confusing because you are supposed to be able to do all of your controls from the touch screen directly from the Echo Show.  It is not very user friendly.  You are also supposed to be able to control all your devices from the Alexa app on your phone, which I also find not very user friendly.Overall I am very disappointed.  I am sure this device would work as I would want it to work but I do not have the time to get a phD in figuring out the settings.  I also shouldn't have to for simple basic requests my 1st gen Echo was able to do directly out of the box!","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,196

"TL;DR summary: Defective model; find an old model, or wait for the next oneMaybe I got 2 lemons in a row, but I doubt it.I've bought 8 Echo Show devices (3 different models) since the first one in 2018...and that first one is still going strong 6.5yrs of constant use later (even though Alexa seems to have gotten only stupider instead of smarter over time)! (Won't even get into how many other Echo/Alexa products I've been pleased with.)I bought this ""newest model"" of the Show 5 (in the new Cloud Blue color) in Oct 2024. Within hours of setup, it was acting up, and doing so in some ways that none of my others ever have after years of use. I called Amazon, did all the troubleshooting, and an hour later, they finally agreed to send out a new one. The 2nd one (which arrived also looking brand new, not returned and repackaged) acted exactly the same as the first, with exactly the same weird random defects.ISSUES:**1** The most frequent & most recurring issue: The screen would go entirely black (as if unplugged), but if I said ""Alexa,"" the colored bar would appear at the bottom to let me know it was listening. If I just asked a simple question, it would give me a verbal response (as expected), and write the words it was saying in white text on the same pitch black background, then it would go black again. (If you haven't had an Echo Show, there's always a visual background on at all times, albeit sometimes dim if it's in ""sleep"" mode...at least the way they've always worked for me. IF a ""screen off mode"" option exists, I wasn't using it, so it was not behaving normally.) Worse, if I asked anything else of it while in this ""black screen state,"" such as ""Play music"" or ""turn on kitchen light"" or tried to activate one of its many ""Skills"" (AKA ""apps"") it would again show the colored bar that indicating it was listening as I spoke, then...NOTHING, nada, nil...no response at all. I could repeat the command, or try another...same thing. So, it wasn't frozen, just glitching. The only way to stop it was to pull it from power, then plug it back in. It would then work ok for a bit before doing the same thing again within hours.I wasted 2-3 hours troubleshooting mostly this issue with 4 different Amazon reps over 3 calls (before and after receiving the 2nd one). Amazon claims that this is NOT a known issue (I don't believe that for a second since this exact model had already been out for 1+ yrs prior to my purchase, yet the exact same thing happened to me twice in a row on two brand new devices). Just for **** & giggles (and bc I really wanted a new device to use in my kitchen plus they keep discontinuing the older models with proven reliability), I asked if they could send me a 2nd replacement (3rd device), but in a different color (thinking that maybe the Cloud Blue had a defective batch and I got 2 of the bad eggs), but nope. So I just returned both defectives for refund and am doing without.MORE TYPICAL ISSUES (that I very rarely experience on my other Echo Shows, but 2+ times on this model over just the first 24hrs):*2* Completely freezing on a screen completely unresponsive (have to pull plug to fix);*3* Not going into ""sleep mode"" (dim screen, just a fixed bckgd image w/ clock) as expected after hours in a dark room;*4* OR the opposite...not waking from ""sleep mode"" when I return to the room, turn on the light, and start making noise (it's supposed to recognize someone's around, brighten the screen, and resume it's active standby state of scrolling news stories, recipes, product recommendations, etc.)...not even when I'd say ""Alexa""!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,647

"The Echo Show 5 - a smart device so clever, it knows exactly what I don’t want and shows it to me anyway. I thought I was buying a clock with benefits, but what I got instead was the world’s tiniest Times Square right in my living room. And spoiler alert: the ads don’t even have the decency to be entertaining.The Good:It tells time! Sometimes. When it’s not busy hawking vitamins or Amazon deals. Need to know if you're late for a meeting? Well, good luck—you're gonna have to wait for that ad for a watch you don’t want to disappear first.It has a screen! A screen that displays the weather, reminders, and, oh yeah, those same relentless ads. If only there were an award for “Most Frustrating Use of Technology.”Alexa still listens...occasionally. But if you ask her what time it is during her ad break, be prepared for the silent treatment. Priorities, I guess.The Bad:Ads, Ads, Ads: I didn’t realize I was signing up for a 24/7 Amazon infomercial. I’ve turned off more settings than a NASA launch control panel, yet the ads keep coming—like that one overly persistent sales rep who doesn’t take a hint.It’s distracting: Picture this: I’m sitting at my desk, trying to get some work done. I glance over for the time, and BAM! A supplement ad pops up. Nothing says “be productive” like being guilt-tripped into buying fish oil capsules.The Ugly:Even after diving deep into the settings to turn off every notification, ad preference, and suggested game (seriously, who wants to play a game on this thing?), it still found a way to sneak in more ads. TWICE every minute for SIX seconds. Yes, I timed it because I have nothing better to do when waiting for the clock to reappear. That’s 20% of my life stolen by a device I bought.Final Verdict:The Echo Show 5 is like that friend who’s great at parties but won’t stop trying to sell you their MLM products. It has so much potential—smart home integration, weather updates, alarms—but it’s ruined by its obsession with turning your home into a virtual billboard. If you’re into Stockholm Syndrome, this might just be the gadget for you. Otherwise, save your money and buy a regular clock. At least those don’t try to upsell you protein shakes.I have rated 5 stars but in reality it really deserves 2/5 stars. One for the time-telling (when it feels like it) and one for the screen (even if it’s mostly ads).

"So, you may no longer use this as a visual telephone device - my friends and I use this to talk on all the time - earlier versions of the Echo Show 8 were much better than even placing an I-Phone call with FaceTime.  Now the new version's DEFAULT view is of your whole room and background - not a close-up face to face call type of thing.  They do this so it can act as a security device - which is just stupid, because it is a live view and doesn't even record!  If I wanted a security camera, that's what I'd get.  But all previous versions were ""close up"" - I called to see if I could change the default view - but NOPE! This is their new default.  Won't be buying any more and I have about 10 of them in my house.  As I said, absolutely horrid!  The colors are distorted horribly as well.  When I called my friend, she said - Do you have a bad sunburn?  (Duh!  No, it's the middle of winter... but that's how it looked!) This is the third MAJOR complaint that I've had with Amazon in as many mouths, and I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall... they are a company who no longer works to produce products and services that their customers want, leading me to believe, that with the change of leadership, they are going into that well-known phase of so many companies known as DECLINE!","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,250

Apparently, spending a lot of money on these devices is not enough, because I am constantly bombarded with subtle and not-so-subtle pitches to buy, or subscribe to, products and services offered by Amazon. The uptick in recent months has been obvious. Even the innocuous games, requests or routines I like bring suggestions to upgrade or buy.Shopping suggestions are sometimes helpful but can also feel like a money-grab when it suggests I re-order things I've just ordered in a six-month quantity.And the AI is not great. For instance, I asked it to stop showing me sports scores because it was spoiling the results of games I had recorded. So instead I'm greeted with highlight thumbnails that do the same thing.You can turn off most of this stuff by activating Do Not Disturb, but that also quiets most notifications you've set up.In 2024, I would expect better technology.

Good luck actually finishing installing it let alone using it. The power cord is deliberately made faulty in such a way that it unplugs itself from gentle tapping on the screen. This is most likely done to push for the mount. The installation setup is littered with ads for garbage like Amazon Music and Audible.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,55
"Don't buy this product.  I purchased two and both were defective. I returned them and they were replaced with two more. Both were again defective. All you can get is the time in big ""ugly"" numbers and even that goes away. I do have to say if you can get some sound from them, it is really very nice. But the product is totally not worth the money. Definitely not worth $89 or $49 either.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,75
The screen always attacks you with ads that you cannot turn off. It should be communicated upfront so I wouldn't waste my time buying and returning this. Never again.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,29

"The media could not be loaded.I purchased 2 Echo Show 5’s in October 2023. Almost to the day after the warranty from Amazon expired 1 year later, both units begun having several technical glitches with the software and one unit now has screen tearing on the right side which is unfixable using the Amazon technical forum articles. I have spent dozens of hours reading through these guides to get the software to stop glitching and changing screens only to have the hardware side become basically a door stop. What a waste of money these units are and having had to pay for the 25.00 stands on top of the original purchase price for each one! I feel completely taking advantage of by Amazon’s Sales and Hardware Departments. And the Customer Service Department is unbearable. No more Amazon Hardware purchases after this nightmare. Hope their A.I. doesn’t break the world too!","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,150

"My echo wakes me up, gives me a morning greeting, tells me what’s in my calendar for the day, gives me a weather, news and traffic report, and even a positive affirmation ( cause, why not?).When my dog barks, echo plays soothing sounds for dogs and send me a notification so I check in on them with the camera. I love the sound quality, great for blasting MY music while I cook the recipe echo knew I would like.I have all this set up and catered to me, and I’m  not a tech savvy person, it’s that easy to do.

"I have to either be within five feet of the device for it to reliably pick up its wake word (Echo) or I have to repeatedly scream at it from 5-8 feet away (the distance between where it sits in my dining room and to the end of the kitchen) for it to execute whatever command I'm issuing (play a channel on Sirius XM, tell me my timers, what's the weather, etc. - all very basic/simple). Very frustrating. I would recommend you heavily test your device within the return period to make sure you don't get a dud like mine apparently is.","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024",2.0 out of 5 stars,102

I had the large screen version in my living room and this smaller one in the bedroom. I do like them BUT I do NOT like being spied on. I would mention a song while speaking on the phone (different device) in the same room and within minutes the option to purchase the album of the song I mentioned pops up on the echo!

Amazon cant seem to get out of their own way. This device was bought for a smart baby monitor screen but wont stop advertising products on Amazon and Alexa capabilities.

"This is the worst echo Device I have ever bought. I’ve been using echo for my lights etc since the 2nd generation, and they all have been great. I bought this one for the kitchen so that I can pull up timers and such and it rarely responds the first time. I wish I wouldn’t have bought this one.
