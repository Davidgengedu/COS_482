"The speaker sounds a bit better than the past generation, and the sounds are noticeably clearer (or less muddy). Although I like both the old and new designs, I personally like this a bit more. It feels surprisingly high quality in the hand and is the obviously better deal when compared with a HomePod mini's price-to-performance ratio. I am a big fan of this Echo Dot generation's aesthetics. To me, it looks and feels premium--like a tech product I would leave purposely visible as part of my area, opposed to one I would manage hidden under my desk, behind a lamp, etc. My favorite new feature is the inclusion of a tap-to-play/pause function, and my biggest complaint is the lack of further music/media integration on the Alexa mobile app (as trying to play or queue up specific songs/playlists from Apple Music can be frustrating).Overall, you can't go wrong with this speaker for the price (and functionality it offers), especially when pairing two for a stereo pair.","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,166

So this black device came with a white cord. Was not expecting that at all. All my previous Echo devices came with a black cord. Seems like not the end of the world. I have a tower power strip that is pretty full. Sits on floor. The other black cords in there don't really show. Kind of blend in with the shadows near the floor. This one looks terrible and the white sticks out like a sore thumb and a beacon in the night. Looks really messy and tacky. I honestly would not have purchased this device if I had known it had a black cord. Never seen a white cord from Amazon. I should have looked at the pics more thoroughly perhaps. Given my past experience it never crossed my mind. Sorry I bought it and not going to use it. How does it work? I don't know.

"One of the most genuine pieces of garbage I’ve ever bought ; the probelm with the Amazon echo is the constant push advertisement. Do you wanna actually use the machine you spent your hard worked money on? Too bad cause there’s around 50 paywalls for literally everything; I do the most basic mechanics “Alexa turn on the light” after 2 months it stopped working and now when I turn on the light Jeffery Bozo shoves the fact I can have some celebrity from the 90’s who needs another paycheck ; say In their funny little voice how great it is I’m turning on my lights for 5 dollars a month! WOW !! And that’s not all, if I wanna rest my eyes after a long day and I ask Alexa to play some white noise ; 7/10 times she’s gonna be advertising “better white noise” and the advertisement is going to last 3 minutes each time unless you scream at the robot to stop , and play your white noise, and once a month it just straight up “can’t access it” . If you want an Alexa for 20 dollars, make sure you have an extra 200 for the 2 years this thing will work.","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,205

If you research it it will tell you you can that Amazon has changed the settings to the point where you have to leave Amazon music on your echo dot there’s nothing you can do about it and even if you change your music preferences to Spotify, it still will use Amazon music which makes absolutely no damn sense. up until now I actually liked it, but they say you can ask the Alexa to do things in the settings and apparently you can’t do any of that because if you ask Alexa to do anything in the settings, she just opened settings for you and doesn’t explain or take you to any of the stuff you’re asking her to. maybe if they make it so you can take the Amazon music off the echo dot a easier, ill like it more but its slowly starting to aggravate me like there terrible basic light bulbs……","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024",2.0 out of 5 stars,192

"The Amazon Echo Dot is the perfect addition to any home, combining a compact design with impressive sound quality and Alexa’s endless capabilities. Whether it’s for music, smart home control, or quick voice commands, this little speaker delivers big results.The sound is surprisingly vibrant and clear for such a small speaker. The bass is punchy, vocals are crisp, and it easily fills a bedroom, dining room, or small living space. It’s perfect for streaming playlists, podcasts, or even ambient sounds for relaxation.Alexa works flawlessly with this device. From controlling my smart lights and thermostat to setting timers, alarms, and reminders, the Echo Dot has quickly become part of my daily routine. It’s also great for quick weather updates, news, and fun trivia with Alexa’s skills.The sleek, modern design fits beautifully in any room. It’s compact enough to sit on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or shelf without taking up much space. The built-in LED display on some models is a bonus for showing the time or alarms.It seamlessly connects to other smart home devices, making it a hub for my smart lights, plugs, and speakers. Multi-room audio is a game-changer when paired with other Echo devices – I can play music throughout the house with a simple voice command.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,208

I suspect if I paid the annual subscription for Amazon Kids+ it would work seamlessly.  I just refuse to subscribe when there is tons of free content...alexa just doesnt work with other streaming services like it claims.I am probably going to have to create my 10yo his OWN amazon account so that I can setup the Alexa app for his account rather than trying to give him skills as a child profile on my account.

"Just not that great. I traded my old Echo Dots (small pucks) for this and 2 Echo Pops.So here we go....It comes with it's own LARGE WHITE plug almost 3 inches big. No more USB which makes it difficult to place- I have USB outlets to save space.The Dot itself is big and awkward. It doesn't fit into places easily. Older Dots could be mounted on the wall, under cabinets, and on the sides of a nightstand and still operate. These larger Dots just take up space and don't hide well, especially with the bright white cord and fat plug.It lights up the same as all Alexa stuff. Nothing new or fantastic.It seems to mis-hear a lot. More than older Dots.I can't go over Sound Quality because I only use this Echo Dot for light control and rarely Spotify. Since I moved houses it's just a voice controlled light switch. I used my older Echo Dots for motion sensors, lights, alarms door locks, sequences before moving.If you are looking to ""upgrade"" I'd just hold onto older Dots.It's not a status symbol to show off an Echo Dot.

"I bought the Echo Dot hoping it would make a decent white noise machine and I was deeply mistaken. I on random occasions can get the Dot to play 'rain sounds' properly but most of the time I was met with a long monologue informing me I could pay a fee for white noise if I wished. Any effort to decline the subscription or try to get the Dot to just play the free version of white noise was met with silence.I tried to research how to fix the issue and most people online said to request 'Sleep Sounds'. My Dot recognized this command and would even say 'playing sleep sounds now' but nothing would play. Also, in the instances where I was able to get rain sounds to play it doesn't loop, it will abruptly stop without you asking and you'll have to pull teeth in order to get the white noise back.I don't have other Amazon home products so I wanted this for the white noise and the alarm clock.
