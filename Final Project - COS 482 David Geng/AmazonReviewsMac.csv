"When I get home from work and am starving, a packet of this is my go to. I just don't have time to cook sometimes. I rarely eat processed foods but this is the exception. It's just the right amount of food for me and it's tasty, ready quickly, and I love it. Box of 18 is great. I like that it's individually wrapped but there's no plastic or Styrofoam cup included, which is good because it's not good to cook in those. It can go in the microwave in a mug but believe it or not, I make it on the stove. Ready in about 5 minutes!","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,108

"I'm a big fan of Kraft Easy Mac Original Mac & Cheese! As a busy person, I appreciate the convenience of these microwavable packets. They're easy to prepare, and the mac and cheese is creamy and delicious. I love that I can have a comforting, satisfying meal in just a few minutes. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the packets could be a bit larger, as I often find myself wanting more. However, the value for the price is great, and I'd definitely recommend Kraft Easy Mac to anyone looking for a quick and easy meal.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,101
"I mistakenly thought these were the boxes of Mac & Cheese you can get but they are actually 6 small packets of noodles and dry cheese sauce.  Each one makes about six to ten spoonsful.  It is a tiny snack rather than a meal.  I made them like the directions said and didn't cover them when I put them in the microwave and it made a big mess - the starchy water got all over the microwave.  Then I covered them the next time and it didn't make a mess but the pasta was dry so had to add a little more water.  Truly, more trouble than it is worth and they didn't taste very good either.  Won't get again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,120

I'm only giving this three stars. Delivery was great and the product is pretty good. I minus one star because it amazes me how in the world does a couple of packages in a very strong box end up broken. This is not the fault of delivery. The box itself is very strong. But I opened it up and one or two packages are always broken. How does that happen? Unless it's at the manufacturing end. They need to do a better job. Perhaps during packaging a machine is Miss adjusted and the plastic wrap gets ripped? But then the noodles would end up on the manufacturing floor not in the box? I see many comments here stating the same thing. Luckily it's an easy fix of just gathering the noodles up. Not a waste just an inconvenience. And at this price I would still buy them because they're a great nifty idea. As an adult male I need at least two packages to make a meal. So I get nine meals at this incredible price.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,176

I donate these to a local food bank on a subscription basis with Amazon and they are a favorite of those eating them because of the individual size and microwave preparation. It tastes the same as the stuff you make out of the box and eliminates having to cook it on a stovetop and then deal with storing any leftovers.

I’ve bought this is mac n cheese multiple times and it’s been fine. The last 2 orders I’ve received the boxes were either opened and the noodles were smashed. And this last order the taste is horrible. It smells like dog food or burnt cheese. And the taste is just gross. I’ve already thrown away 2 boxes because Amazon won’t return food items and they will only refund a food item once. Which is ridiculous. So now I’ve gotten 3 bad boxes of mac n cheese and just out that money with no replacements. Very very disappointed recently with Amazon and the food delivery and products.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,106

"This is a handy way to keep a lot of the single portion instant Mac in a smaller space. This worked well for my dorm time when getting food would be a pain. This worked really well paired with a pouch of tuna for some extra protein. When I got the box though, there was powder and a few burst packets making a mess everywhere. There was enough servings that losing a few wasn't too bad but I was vacuuming up that white whatever that's in there to cook the noodles from my carpet any time I made a meal.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,100
