"Kraft Deluxe Original Mac & Cheese is a classic comfort food that never disappoints. The creamy cheese sauce is rich and flavorful, and the pasta cooks up perfectly every time. It‚Äôs a quick and easy meal that‚Äôs perfect for busy weeknights or lazy weekends.While it may not be the healthiest option, it's undeniably delicious. A childhood favorite that still holds up today.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,62

I don't have time to breathe let alone visit a grocery store, so finding things I can somewhat cook in a flash that don't require refrigerated items is a blessing. You don't need butter or milk for this mac and cheese, thank god. I can order condiments off Amazon if I wanna spice up the flavor, but I'm happy to have this plain, or with spicy sauce, or ketchup. Great if you have very little time and/or are heavily introverted and hate visiting grocery stores. 10/10.","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,95

"I have had a lot of cheap mac and cheese in my life, which means I don't consume a lot of kraft mac and cheese.  That being said, I had to have the lowest price point non-dry mac and cheese on Amazon.  Which was a 3-pack of kraft deluxe.  The pasta is so much more dense and the cheese sauce is more plentiful, more cheesy, and less salty than Velveeta or dollar store varieties.  Turned the usual dry mac and cheese casserole (tuna, peas, 2tbsp fine-minced onion), sometimes a one-sitting meal, into a much denser meal I eat a cupful at a time and find more enjoyable.The higher price is justified.  Feel free to lower it anytime, though, Kraft.","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,119

"The lead is that with this baby - the ""DELUXE"" edition - Kraft has officially brought back the gooey cheese that used to come in a can.  Now it comes in a foil packet.  It's squishy, already pre-mixed and is NOT the ""standard"" Kraft cheese powder that comes in other boxes.This means more convenience, less waste and none of that ""congealed"" powder that doesn't quite dissolve with the macaroni!  The same beautiful taste I remember!  This is a BIGGER deal than most realize.  Thank you!","Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,85

Tastes decent enough. Would recommend tossing in a few chunks of some nice sharp/aged cheddar as well as a cup and a half of peas or some other veggies. The cheddar to add a bit more flavor and veggies to cut the richness of the packet cheese.

"This is excellent Mac & Cheese.  Just boil water, drain and mix in the readymade cheese sauce.  I love boxed Mac and Cheese, but don‚Äôt like having to add the milk, butter and powder.  Although, with the Rapid Mac Cooker, it‚Äôs fast to make.  Kraft Deluxe doesn‚Äôt do well in the Rapid Mac Cooker.  So I now boil the water on the stove.  The box says to boil the macaroni for 11 to 12 minutes.  I always taste-test pasta as it cooks.  It only takes about 8.5 to 9 minutes.  It comes out slightly al dente, but I like that way better than having the macaroni overcooked and mushy.  Of course, that‚Äôs up to each individual.  If you like the pasta a lot more tender, then I‚Äôd estimate 10 to 12 minutes.  Any way you like it, it‚Äôs excellent Mac & Cheese and very easy and fast to make.  The sauce mixes in much more easily than the powder does.  Just buy some and ENJOY!  The price is much better at the warehouse clubs.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,174
