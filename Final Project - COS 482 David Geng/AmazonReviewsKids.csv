I find it annoying that you can‚Äôt use this as a Bluetooth speaker.  If you‚Äôre wanting to play something from a phone or other device you can‚Äôt link and use the echo as a speaker device.  Just silly to buy another device to use as a Bluetooth speaker in addition to this!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,52
"We've had these things for 2 years and they're awful. I wanted a device that the kids could use for games and music, but the controls that I set for one inevitably get applied to the 2nd. I've attached them to my Spotify account, but that has only added more issues. One of them seems to get stuck on Do Not Disturb more often than not and requires a call to customer service to re-set and clear it out.  I'm now hoping to remove the Amazon Kids and just have them function on their own, but I can't even see where that is possible. Absolutely awful. We should have just bought more of the Google versions, since that gets used daily without issue.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,123

"Update from 1* to 3*Initial Complaints:Device would not connect to or even pull up a list of wifi options, when sibling devices had no problem doing so.I read this device has issues with modern wifi networks. Might have been the problem, but Amazon denied it.New Review:After my initial review, Amazon support contacted me with a new manual step to try using amazon tap. I'm glad my time and money are no longer wasted. It is a bit frustrating that they kept trying to blame my wifi when all evidence pointed at the device being lacking (including the way the issue was ultimately resolved), but at least this finally works now. If anyone else has a similar issue, make sure they have you try the tap/non-bluetooth method for older devices so you don't have as rough a time getting yours working.Still, I advise looking into their newer devices if you don't want the potential hassle. Echo Pop for example was immediately successful and did not take days of troubleshooting.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,168

"I'd like to use the product.  I've spent 3 hours trying to set it up.  I worked with software for 35 years and I've had no problem setting up hundreds of other things.They're big problems with his software and they require you to constantly rekey your password and key in a texted number.I think I'm going to send this product back.  I'm about ready to slam it against the wall and it's not worth the hassle.Update: after needlessly waiting for the required 24 hours to reset the OTP passwords, I was able to get it set up and working.  I relied mainly on YouTube videos to do so.  It works okay, but there still needs to be more instructions to be able to do things like easily change the music from the defaulted Amazon music and to use the echo Dot as a bluetooth speaker from my cell phone.  The music quality of the speaker is actually quite good.  I'm changing my ranking from one star to three stars.","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,169

"We loved this product at first. Then we discovered that you cannot play Christmas music or Christian music on the device.  To add to this, the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù radio station dropped an f-bomb on a Sabrina Carpenter song.

Even if the speakers aren't connected, you are forced to use the same music service and it's a HOT mess. The voice creeps her out too, so I've decided to just get her a bluetooth speaker.On the plus side, she liked having it read stories.

"Save your money and just get the light. I'm glad I got this on sale for half off because there is no way this is worth it full price. I bought it to replace my kids night light, play music, and use white noise. The light works great. Still cannot get the music to work. I want to play Amazon music, but it refuses to recognize anything I try to play even though all the skills are enabled and it's set to default. The only music service I've been able to get working is Pandora, even after researching for hours. I thought the white noise was great, at first. Then the Internet disconnected in the middle of the night and Alexa yells a big long message about the Internet being down and what to do waking my kids up. It cannot be turned off. Are you kidding me? Either the white noise has to be turned waaaay down so that you can't hear the message or you have to turn it off at night. Either way you don't get white noise. Some of the things you can program it to do are cute, but honestly the more I read up on issues that I find the more I get the impression that this whole product is overly complicated and poorly designed.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024",2.0 out of 5 stars,221

"I bought the Owl for my son last year for his 7th birthday. He had been begging for an echo dot. He was SO excited to finally get it. It‚Äôs cute, durable, turns on, lights up, she talks, seems great‚Ä¶ but we can‚Äôt get it to connect to our WiFi. We‚Äôve tried consistently, I even downloaded the Alexa app like the instructions say to do and it just won‚Äôt do it. The ring light at the bottom of the owl, changes color when it‚Äôs ready to connect but it won‚Äôt actually connect. Pretty disappointing because now it just sits collecting dust. My son always asks me to set it up and we‚Äôve tried many times, and followed the directions as given and she just won‚Äôt connect. Waste of money in opinion with a sad little boy who wanted this thing so badly for it to just become a paperweight. We‚Äôve even changed our WiFi provider a few months ago and tried it again and it still won‚Äôt work properly.

My 9 year old is starting to really get into music and loves her alexa. If she‚Äôs not listening to music she has on ‚Äúrain sounds‚Äù at night for sleep. Great product.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,32

"Love this echo dot for our child. Has parental settings with it to block them from playing with it late at night. Perfect for white noise and morning alarm. I love using the app with it too, I couldn't reach my babysitter one night (left phone downstairs all was fine not an emergency), but I was able to send a message through it for my child to tell the babysitter to call me and it worked!","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,76

"Whenever me or daughter requests specific songs to play,  more often she doesn't play that even asking for 10 times  and just play a random similar song.","Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2024",2.0 out of 5 stars,27
"We recently added the Echo Dot Owl to our home, and it has quickly become a favorite for my preschooler! The ability to control her nightlight and change its color to match her mood has made bedtime much more enjoyable. She loves experimenting with the different hues, creating a cozy atmosphere just for her.What really impressed me is how well Alexa responds to her little voice. Even when she doesn‚Äôt articulate clearly, Alexa understands her requests‚Äîmuch better than I expected! My daughter enjoys asking for music, and I appreciate that it pulls from her Spotify Kids account, ensuring that the songs playing are always age-appropriate.She‚Äôs also discovered the joy of storytelling; she frequently asks Alexa to tell her a story. We‚Äôve started using it as a timer for her activities and even as a gentle alarm in the mornings.On top of all these fantastic features, the design of the Echo Dot Owl is super cute! We‚Äôre even considering getting the little nest stand for added charm. Overall, this device has been a wonderful addition to our home, providing entertainment, comfort, and a touch of magic for my child. I highly recommend it for any family with young kids!","Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,198

Bought this for my son for Christmas because he's always asking the adult alexa questions so I thought this would be perfect for his room. The dragon design is awesome. Love that it's kids oriented so I don't have to worry about what comes out of it. the kids love dancing to music they ask it to play before going to school in the morning. It's also a great alarm for in the morning! I would recommend!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,77
