"These do work, but they don’t work miracles. I definitely noticed a difference but my teeth aren’t super white. There was never tooth sensitivity but the strips did irritate my gums a little bit. I just took a day off when they bothered me and it was fine. I recommend but on sale. The results I saw for full price isn’t worth it in my opinion.

Also I would only brush my teeth once a day because my gums would get bruises if I brush more. I never had this issue when I was younger, this just started not long ago maybe due to aging.

"First yes this product absolutely works to whiten your teeth.  No matter where you look this one works on regular teeth staining.  I have used ~ half of the package now (once per week) and see a noticeable difference in my teeth color.The only thing that users should be warned about is to be a bit careful if you have sensitive gums to make sure you don't get too much overlap from the base of the teeth onto the gums.  I have some sensitivity and I can notice when I get the strip too far onto the gums.  Otherwise these are great, easy to use, clean up nicely and would purchase them again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,113

"Update and some advice:These whitening strips really work, they make my teeth look noticeably whiter after just a few uses. However, I’ve had to adjust how I use them because they cause sensitivity and some pain several hours later. For example, if I leave them on for more than 20 minutes, I start feeling sharp sensitivity, especially when I drink water or coffee afterward. Now, I limit my usage time to max 20 mins, and it helps a bit with the discomfort. The results are great, but the sensitivity is a downside. If you have sensitive teeth like me, you might want to be cautious.","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,105

These teeth whiteners are by far the best out there. They do make your teeth a little sensitive so if that’s an issue for you I do not recommend using these. But if you’re looking for something to get your teeth white quick this is the product. I use a strip about once a month and you only leave them on for 45 min at a shot.
