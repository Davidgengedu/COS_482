One thing I have noticed is that when I open a new bag and compare a fresh treat with one that is from last month’s shipment, the color is very different. The new treats are always darker.

"Wag Waffle Bites would be a tasty, wholesome treat if it weren't for the titanium dioxide. ""For color""??? The European Food Safety Authority has banned titanium dioxide as a food additive due to genotoxicity which may lead to carcinogenic effects. Titanium dioxide is fine for house paint, but I don't use titanium dioxide containing sun block because it's absorbed through the skin; and I'm certainly not going to feed it to my dog! And why would any canine desire a tasteless, white, opaque pigment in his food and why would any human wish to feed his/her loving companion a genotoxic, carcinogenic substance?","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,102
